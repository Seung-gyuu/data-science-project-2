- **Environment:** Google Colab

## 📊 Visualizations
| Type | Description | Insight |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Scatter Plot | House_Price_Index vs Real_Disposable_Income | Positive relationship between income and house prices |
| Bar Chart | Year vs Real_GDP | Long-term GDP growth trend |
| Combo Chart | CPI (bar) vs Mortgage Rate (line) | Inflation rises as mortgage rates decline |
| Subplots | Stock vs CPI | Both increase over time, reflecting inflationary growth |


## 🧩 Key Takeaways
### 💰 Key Insight 1 — Income vs House Prices

The analysis reveals a strong positive relationship between **Real Disposable Income** and **House Price Index**.  
As income levels rise, house prices tend to increase, suggesting that **income growth plays a key role in driving housing demand**.



### 💰 Key Insight 2 — Inflation and Mortgage Rates

Between 1980 and 2020, the **mortgage rate** showed a clear downward trend, while the **Consumer Price Index** continued to rise steadily.
This contrast suggests that declining borrowing costs may have supported continued housing market growth despite inflationary pressures.



### 💰 Key Insight 3 — Stock Market and Consumer Prices Over Time

Over the observed period, both the **Stock Price Index** and the **Consumer Price Index** steadily increased,
indicating that financial market performance and consumer prices have generally moved in parallel, reflecting long-term economic expansion.
